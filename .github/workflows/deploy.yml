# ============================================================================
# GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow for .NET 10 Application
# ============================================================================
# This file automates building and deploying your app to Railway
# Every time you push code to the 'main' branch, this workflow runs automatically
# ============================================================================

name: Deploy to Railway

# WHEN does this workflow run?
# Trigger: Whenever code is pushed to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Change this if your default branch is 'master' instead of 'main'

# WHAT jobs should run?
jobs:
  # Job 1: Build and Deploy
  build-and-deploy:
    # WHERE does this job run?
    # Uses Ubuntu Linux (latest version) - it's free and fast
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # STEPS: What actions to perform (runs in order, top to bottom)
    steps:
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 1: Get your code from GitHub
      # ========================================================================
      # This downloads your repository code so GitHub Actions can work with it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Official GitHub action to clone your repo
      
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 2: Install .NET 10 SDK
      # ========================================================================
      # GitHub Actions doesn't have .NET 10 by default, so we install it
      - name: Setup .NET 10 SDK
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4  # Official Microsoft action
        with:
          dotnet-version: '10.0.x'  # 'x' means "latest 10.0 version"
          # This installs the preview version of .NET 10
      
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 3: Restore NuGet packages (dependencies)
      # ========================================================================
      # Downloads all the libraries your project needs (like MediatR, EF Core, etc.)
      - name: Restore dependencies
        run: dotnet restore src/TodoTasks.API/TodoTasks.API.csproj
        # 'run:' executes a command in the terminal
        # This is like running the command on your local machine
      
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 4: Build the application
      # ========================================================================
      # Compiles your C# code to check for errors
      - name: Build application
        run: dotnet build src/TodoTasks.API/TodoTasks.API.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore
        # --configuration Release: Optimized for production (faster, smaller)
        # --no-restore: Skip restore since we already did it in Step 3
      
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 5: Publish as self-contained deployment
      # ========================================================================
      # Creates a standalone executable with .NET runtime included
      - name: Publish self-contained application
        run: |
          dotnet publish src/TodoTasks.API/TodoTasks.API.csproj \
            --configuration Release \
            --output ./publish \
            --self-contained true \
            --runtime linux-x64 \
            /p:PublishSingleFile=false
      
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 6: Create a simple Dockerfile for Railway
      # ========================================================================
      # Railway needs a Dockerfile to know how to run your app
      - name: Create Railway Dockerfile
        run: |
          cat > ./publish/Dockerfile << 'EOF'
          FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:8.0
          WORKDIR /app
          COPY . .
          RUN chmod +x TodoTasks.API
          ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:$PORT
          ENTRYPOINT ["./TodoTasks.API"]
          EOF
      
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 7: Install Railway CLI
      # ========================================================================
      # Railway CLI is needed to deploy from GitHub Actions
      - name: Install Railway CLI
        run: npm install -g @railway/cli
        # Installs Railway's command-line tool globally
      
      # ========================================================================
      # STEP 8: Deploy to Railway
      # ========================================================================
      # Uses Railway CLI to deploy the compiled application
      - name: Deploy to Railway
        run: |
          cd ./publish
          railway up --service ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID }}
        env:
          RAILWAY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
        # Environment variable RAILWAY_TOKEN authenticates with Railway
        # railway up: Deploys the current directory to Railway
        # Railway will auto-detect the service from the linked project

# ============================================================================
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (One-time setup):
# ============================================================================
# 1. Go to your GitHub repository
# 2. Click "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
# 3. Click "New repository secret"
# 4. Add two secrets:
#    - Name: RAILWAY_TOKEN
#      Value: (Get from Railway Dashboard → Account Settings → Tokens)
#    - Name: RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME
#      Value: (Your Railway service name, e.g., "todotasks-api")
# 5. Push this file to GitHub
# 6. Done! Every push to 'main' will auto-deploy to Railway
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# HOW TO USE:
# ============================================================================
# 1. Make changes to your code
# 2. git add .
# 3. git commit -m "Your message"
# 4. git push origin main
# 5. Go to GitHub → Actions tab → Watch it build and deploy automatically!
# 6. Check Railway dashboard to see your app go live
